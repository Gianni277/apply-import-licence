    <p>You must ask an admin from your organisation to invite you to join. They can do this from their dashboard.</p>

    <p>Once your account is set up, you can:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-body">
      <li>Perform various actions on the platform</li>
      <li>Access specific features and tools</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If your organisation did not set up an account, please <a href="/Contact"> contact us</a>.</p>
